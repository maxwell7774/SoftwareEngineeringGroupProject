# GP-Process Model Justification
By, Yucheng Long, Bryce Mecham, and Adam Maxwell

## Describe the model we are going to use for our development. 

Incremental Model

The incremental model releases "increments" of a program. Each increment is run through requirements, design, coding, and testing. Then it is released. This gives an early release of a product without maybe having all the features implemented already. Then it allows you to release more increments after which allows for added features and bug fixes.
1. The first increment we will release will focus mainly on implementing our primary goals. This will ensure that we have a working project that we can get credit for.
2. The second increment we will release will focus on our secondary goals, and bug fixes. This will allow us to keep the users entertained with new features as well as fixing problems that may have been in the first increment.
3. The third increment we will focus on our tertiary goals, and bug fixes. Doing this allows us to have working project early, and lets us break up the tasks into more manageable parts so we're more likely to reach our more unlikely goals.
4. The increments may go on depending on what the clients would like.


## Thoroughly justify why this is the model you are choosing. Why did you choose this model? 
- The reason we chose this model is because we have a deadline for this project to be completed. Because we have a deadline, we need to have the bare minimum done first so we can focus on adding more features after. This is incrementing our project. We are starting with a base working project and iterating on top of it to make it better and implement more features.
- Choosing the incremental model also allows us to fix bugs incrementally instead of whenever they appear if its not a game breaking bug.
- As team, we want to make this game nice, so we are going to plan, code, test and make sure the users have a great experience. Using the incremental model allows us to listen to our user reviews, and implement ideas they may have as well into the next increment.

## What makes this model ideal for your project/team? 
- Since we have a small team, we need a way to break down the tasks. This is so we don't feel overwhelmed, and so we can see progress early on. The incremental model helps us accomplish this. The increments allow us to break down our goals into more manageable pieces. Then as we increment we can add more and more of our goals/features.
- The incremental model is perfect to develop a game with. The game could start out with basic features that may get a user hooked. Then when you increment the game and update it, this will bring more features to the game and keep the user interested in the game instead of the user getting bored and deleting the game.

## How will your team carry out this model?
We will meet together as a team and plan what needs to be done. Then we will make assignments to people. We the can split off and start working on our assignments. Then we can move onto testing. We will also have a deadline for when the first increment needs to be done. This deadline will be before the project is due, so we have time to add some of our stretch goals in the increments after the first one. We have all members of our team who will be programming. Then we have 2 members designated for testing and one for code quality assurance. By doing these things, we will be able to release our first increment. Then we will repeat these steps for as many increments that we need.
