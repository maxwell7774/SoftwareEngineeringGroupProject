# GP-Process Model Justification

## Describe the model we are going to use for our development. 

Incremental Model

The incremental model uses linear order to complete the project, and the addition of each increment means the further improvement of the project. Following are the meanings of each increments:
1. The first incremental mode is the basic function of software.
2. The second incremental mode is a more complex basic function for the project.
3. The third (or latter) incremental mode is an additional function which helps improve user experience.


## Thoroughly justify why this is the model you are choosing. Why did you choose this model? 
1. I am choosing this model because it can help us to finish our project better. Following is the benefit of Incremental Model:
Adding more functions for our project. If we still have extra time, we can add some additional function to our project. This step can be proceeded over and over again.
2. Make sure we can finish it on time. Every time we complete an increment, the software is complete and can be submitted. This project is a course assignment, which means we have an irrevocable deadline. In order to ensure that the project is completed before the deadline, we choose the incremental mode, which is a relatively safe mode.

## What makes this model ideal for your project/team? 
1. This model can prefer our project. Our team will write a game as a basic function of our project. The incremental model would help us to add additional functions later. Keeping on updating the function of our project in order to attract userâ€™s interest.
2. This model can simplify the problem. The Incremental Model can also help our team members to focus on the achievement of some specific functions.
3. This model can help us to review the step of creating a project linearly. The point of this project is to sort out what we've learned from this lecture. Choosing an incremental mode helps us step through the project's challenges. This will help us to better organize the knowledge related to this lecture. It is very difficult to deal with all the problems at once, which is a difficult task for a beginner like me. Therefore, I think the incremental model is a perfect model for my project.

## How will your team carry out this model?
1. First, we will write a basic game. Then, we will add some additional function to the game.
When we have decided on the theme of the game, we will use the following step: 
we will discuss what the first increment of our project will be. The first increment must be completed before the deadline because it is a course assignment. 
2. We will discuss what the second increment is. Our plan is that the second increment will further refine our game, for example by fixing some bugs or modifying the rules of the game. 
3. Finally, we will add some additional features to make the game more interesting.
