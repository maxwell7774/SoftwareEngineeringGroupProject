### II. Project Description
Our goal is to create a platformer game that can be used  across platforms. The concept is an alien whose spaceship has broken down, and to fix it he must collect parts by completing levels which could include trying not to fall or land on dangerous terrain and avoid creatures. We will use a game engine (Cocos2d-x) to create the game.
### III. Language and Resources
We are going to use c++ as our language. We chose C++ because we are also going to use Cocos2d-x which is a game engine that allows for cross platform. Assests for our game will be from opengameart.org which provides open source game assets. Everything we use should be free to use so our cost will be $0.
