Team Name: 
Create an imaginative name for your team
Document Version/Date: Version 1.0
I will consider the latest document the most valid one, but no document is valid until all team mates have signed it. You might consider keeping this document as a pdf. 
Team Members and their associated roles: 
List each team member and describe what they will be responsible for. Make sure to review the group project documents prior to completing this section. All team members are expected to work on each section, but one team member can be responsible for reviewing/editing the final submission. I will review this part to make sure it is well balanced.
Team Member Organization/Justification:
Describe how you are organizing your team and why you chose that organization. If you are having trouble with this section, review the lecture.
Communication System:
	What will be the primary form for your communication and document sharing?
Team Expectations: 
Explain how you will ensure everyone does their part and how you will document everyone’s contribution. Your team will rise or fall together, but exceptions such as a due date extended if you can document a team member is not pulling their weight. A team member can be completely removed with a unanimous vote by all of the team and valid documentation showing they aren’t doing their part.

By Adding my name below this line I acknowledge that I agree to the above responsibilities assigned to me and I understand.
